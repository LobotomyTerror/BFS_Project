Breadth First Search of a graph using an adjacency list and queue to store and traverse the graph to find the shortest path


The idea behind this program is to take graph theory and develop an algorithm to efficently traverse a directed graph using the method of breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the source node to the destination node. This code is also using Abstraction so data is not limited to specific types and can be whatever it needs to be. Also, the idea behind using the adjacency list for storing the links of the directed graph came from this being a sparse graph so operation cost and time is faster then if using an adjacency matrix.
